# For statement

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer n (n>0) and prints the numbers 1,2,3...n on the screen one below the other. Write the program using the FOR statement.

**Example output:**
```
Enter an integer: 3
1
2
3
```

The output of the program must be exactly the same as the example output (the most strict comparison level)
