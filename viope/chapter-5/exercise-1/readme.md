# Checking if a number is even

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and checks whether it is even or odd. If the number is even, print "Number 2 is even.", if it is odd, print "Number 1 is odd.".

**Hint:**
The program is almost the same as in the previous chapter. The new part is: If the remainder is zero, print "even". If the remainder is one, print "odd". Otherwise print an error message.


**Example output:**

```
Enter an integer: 1978
Number 1978 is even.
```

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "
