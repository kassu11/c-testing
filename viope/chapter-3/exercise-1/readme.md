# Numbers and processing them

Write a program that first asks the user for an integer and after that, a floating-point number. Finally, the program prints both numbers on the screen. The floating-point number shall be printed with two decimal places of precision.

**Example output:**

```
Enter an integer: 14
Enter a decimal number:3.123

You entered the integer: 14
You entered the decimal number, rounded to two decimal places: 3.12
```

The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "
